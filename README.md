# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
We were given access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. We were tasked to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, we were to use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in our dataset.
